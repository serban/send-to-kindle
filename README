This is a quick script I whipped up to send any snippet of text to my Kindle.
Mail needs to be set up for this to work.

Here's how to install it:

1) Open Automator
2) Create a new service
3) Make sure the selector menus say
   "Service receives selected *text* in *any application*"
4) Drag a "Run AppleScript" action into your workflow
5) Paste the text of send-to-kindle.applescript into the text area
6) Taylor the script to your needs -- put your Kindle's e-mail address in
   theKindleEmailAddress
6) Save the workflow and give it a meaningful name such as "Send to Kindle"

Automator will save the workflow in ~/Library/Services

To use it, highlight any text on your Mac. Your workflow should appear in the
services menu of the application and in the context menu that appears when you
control-click the text.
